# Content-Based Filtering Book Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a **Content-Based Filtering** recommendation system to suggest books based on their textual content. The system uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to transform book titles into feature vectors, calculates cosine similarity between books, and provides book recommendations based on similarity scores.

### Key Features:
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Recommends books based on textual similarities derived from book titles.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Uses **Cosine Similarity** to measure the similarity between books.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Uses **Truncated SVD** for reducing the TF-IDF feature matrix into two dimensions for easier visualization.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the book recommendations in a 2D space using a scatter plot for better understanding of similarities.
